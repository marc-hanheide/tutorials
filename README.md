# Welcome to Marc's tutorial overview

## General Information and Tutorials

* First of all, of course the official ROS tutorials are an excellent resource
* If you have access to [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (e.g. on https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/hub for [L-CAS](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/) members or https://colab.research.google.com/ in general), there is a very [good list of Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks), covering all aspects of programming, scientific computing, ML, etc.
* General use of [L-CAS software](https://github.com/lcas/rosdistro/wiki#using-the-l-cas-repository-if-you-just-want-to-use-our-software) (enabling our repositories)

## Dialog Design with DialogFlow for Mobile Robots (Simulation)

[DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/) is the framework that fuels the Google Assistant and many other Natural Language Dialog Systems. [DFSimRob](https://github.com/LCAS/robot-dialogflow) is a framework implementing a *fulfillment* server for mobile robots, running entire in simulation in a browser. A robot in a museum can be send around to different exhibits and visitors can have a conversation with a robot. It offers both, a good tutorial on using DialogFlow itself, and designing state-of-the-art dialog systems that are ready to be deployed to real world robots. A demo system with some dialog capabilities is [available](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/simrob/5c66d843be1f4675b80bfd65dcc9e6b4), users can easily build their own dialog agents and [test them in simulation](https://lcas.lincoln.ac.uk/simrob). [Documentation](https://sites.google.com/view/uol-ai-robotics/materials) is available, developed mostly be [Dr Paul Baxter](https://github.com/paul-baxter) in the context of the [AI and Robotics Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/uol-ai-robotics/home) for School Students originally.
